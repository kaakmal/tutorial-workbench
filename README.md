Create and run tutorials in FreeCAD

This is very much a work in progress right now.  
## Current State:
* Base classes for tutorial functionality established
* Can add new steps to tutorials
* Can add information to tutorial via tree (eg, instructions, author name, FreeCAD version)
* Can convert tutorial to QWizard that is playable
* Can play QWizard
## Next Steps:
* Create workbench buttons/interface
* Record commands in a way that is actually usable for highlighting GUI elements
* Make GUI elements highlight
## Later Steps:
* Have tutorial highlight part features (e.g., faces, edges)
* Show where to click with cursor
* Have option to show keyboard shortcuts
* Add hints
* Make hints show up conditionally based on user actions
* Be able to export PDF of tutorial
* Make tutorial automatically advance when step successfully completed
